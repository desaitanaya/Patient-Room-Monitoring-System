# Patient-Room-Monitoring-System
In the current scenario of technological developments the healthcare infrastructure is still underdeveloped and facing a lot of issues.It is estimated that 2.4% of the deaths in the country are incurred due to improper hygiene and non-monitored medical facilities.The main goal of the project is to built a working system which can help monitor the environment of the patient’s room.
The system is aimed at monitoring the temperature, air quality, humidity and light intensity in the room of the patient. The major aim is to provide a monitored facility to avoid chances of any mishaps and to enhance our existing infrastructure.

AIM :The main aim is to develop a simple but robust model which can efficiently detect the room temperature, humidity, air quality and light intensity.
